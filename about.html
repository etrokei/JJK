<h2>Development of JJK</h2>

<p>In 2017, Gege Akutami published Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School, a four-chapter series that ran in Jump Giga from April 28 to July 28.[4][5] The series would later serve as a prologue to Jujutsu Kaisen and was retitled as Jujutsu Kaisen 0.[6] According to Hiroyuki Nakano, the chief editor of Weekly Shōnen Jump, Jujutsu Kaisen received unanimous approval in the serialization committee.[7] It debuted in Weekly Shōnen Jump on March 5, 2018.[8]</p>

<p>Akutami stated that Neon Genesis Evangelion influenced the mythological aspects of the series,[9] being also influenced by horror and found footage films.[10] Akutami is particularly a fan of Yoshihiro Togashi, author of YuYu Hakusho and Hunter × Hunter,[10][11] expressing intentions to have an art style as close as possible to his.[9] The author is also a fan of Tite Kubo, author of Bleach, and discussed in an interview with him the similarities between their works.[12][13] Other manga artists who influenced Akutami include Masashi Kishimoto (Naruto) and Yusuke Murata (Eyeshield 21 and One-Punch Man illustrator).[9]</p>

    </div>
<p>The magic system of Jujutsu Kaisen is largely inspired by Hunter × Hunter, whose fights, in Akutami's words, "rejects emotional arguments", stating however, that like Daisuke Ashihara [ja], World Trigger's author, whose magic system is also similar to Togashi's series, Akutami was trying to find and develop an own style.[10] In particular, Akutami commented that the first chapter was a mix of Bleach and Naruto. Akutami regretted some decisions made for the first chapter, such as the short appearance of Yuji's grandfather.[14]</p>

<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In October 2020, Akutami stated that the story's ending and main stages were planned, but that the path between the two remained "fairly free."[9] In February 2021, Akutami stated that the series would probably be finished within two years, declaring, however, no confidence in that statement. Akutami knew how the story for Megumi Fushiguro would end, but not for Sukuna.[15] On June 9, 2021, it was announced that the manga would enter on hiatus due to the author's health issues;[16][17] it resumed publication on August 2 of the same year.[18][19] In December 2022, Akutami hinted that the manga would end within a year, stating during the Jump Festa '23 event: "If you accompany me for up to one more year (probably), I will be very happy."[20] In December 2023, at the Jump Festa '24 event, Akutami stated in a handwritten comment that it would probably be the last Jump Festa in which the series would continue in serialization, hinting that it would end within 2024;[21] the series concluded on September 30 of said year.[22][23]</p>
